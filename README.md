## Design
I wanted to create a user friendly site the was easily navigated by users with a
design was visually appealing to the user.

### Framework

  * [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  I used Bootstrap as the front end framework as I was familar with this framework as I have
  used before on other project. I like that it is easy to use and easy to style to suit the needs
  of any project.
  * [jQuery 3.4.1](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/)
  I used this to initialise some Bootstrap components and scripts where JavaScript wasnt needed.
  * [Django 3.1.3](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  This was used for Back-End to tie in with the Front-End Bootstrap. I wasnt as familar with this
  but lessons through the course help me become some what familar. The rest was learned as I 
  proceeded building the project.

### Color Scheme
I went with a basic Black and White Color Scheme for most the pages in this site. I wanted to stay 
away from bright colors to help decrease and distraction a user might encounter. This also helps
the user to maybe purchase an item rather than leave the site. I used A simple background image 
to display in the backgound which keeps within the theme of the project.

### Icons

* [Font Awesome 5.11.2](https://fontawesome.com/)
I used Font Awesome Icons as again I was familar using these and they help to bring a site to life.
These were used in the Nav Bar, for social links int the footer. Tags for products, subtle icons on
buttons etc.

### Typography
I used Google Font Gloria Hallelujah as I like this font and believe it works well with theme of this
project.

### Wireframes
I used Balsamiq for the wireframes for this project during the planning stages. I tried to stick to
them as best as possible but during the course of the development slight changes or improvements
were made.

## Features
This project features apps (applications) created by using Django command **python3 manage.py startapp nameofapp**

### Home app
The home app includes the Homepage for the site index.html and the contact, return and delivery pages.

**index (Home Page)**
This is the main homepage for the site. This is where users and start to navigate through the site and
begin to search for products or subscriptons that are available to purchase.

#### Stripe payment testing

My checkout app is using the stripe payment for the payment option. I tested this by using Stripes
test card (4242 4242 4242 4242) I tested the forms and ensured all my validation worked as expected
and my logic was performing as expected. The checkout app works from the Stripe API.

Card number - 4242424242424242

CVC - Any 3 digit number.

Expiry date - Any date in the future.

### GitHub Repository
Check and Expand....

1. Created a repository in GitHub called: mattjboland/ci-milestonefour

2. Initialised git from the terminal using Git Bash:

    git init

3. Created a .gitignore file and I have added the files and folders that won't need to push
to GitHub (i.e. .theia, .gitpod, .dockerfile, .gitpod.yml, env.py, __pycache__/, *.sqlite3, *.pyc)

4. Added the files that I was working on to the Staging area by using:

   git add .

5. Run the commit command with the first commit

  git commit -m â€œinitial commit"

6. Copied from GitHub the following path and I ran it in the Git Bash terminal in order to
indicate where my remote repository is.

 git remote add origin 
 
 git push -u origin master

7. I've run regular commits after every important update to the code, and I pushed the changes
to GitHub using a chained command.

git add .; git commit -m "Commit message"; git push

To deploy Fitness 2020 to heroku, use the following process:

1. Create a requirements.txt file using the terminal command pip freeze > requirements.txt.

2. Create a Procfile with the terminal command echo web: python app.py > Procfile.

3. git add and git commit the new requirements and Procfile and then git push the project 
to GitHub.

4. Sign up for a free Heroku account, Create a new app on the Heroku website by clicking the 
"New" button in your dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to Europe.

5. From the heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > 
"Deployment method" and select GitHub, and enable Automatic Deployment.

6. In the Heroku Resources tab, navigate to the Add-Ons section and search for Heroku Postgres. 
Select the free Hobby level. This will allow you to have a remote database instead of using the 
local sqlite3 database, and can be found in the Settings tab. You'll need to update your .env 
file with your new database-url details. Confirm the linking of the heroku app to the correct 
GitHub repository.

7. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on settings tab and then click on the 
Reveal config vars button to configure environmental variables.

Set the following config vars:
